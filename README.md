# strutil

Powerful and Minimal methods to help you with strings ⚡️.

Note: When I started learning Golang, I thought there's no implementation of some strings methods in the `strings` packages :), so I decided to implement them lol, but later I find out they are already in their :3. & It was a good practice, and I will keep work on it.
